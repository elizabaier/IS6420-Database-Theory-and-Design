IS6420 Database Theory and Design Class Projects: 
This is a repository for the two main projects I did as part of IS6420 Database Theory and Design - the individual Air Quality project and our final group project where we recreated the main bulk of Duolingo's app database, populated it with fake data, and queried it to show the database worked. Both projects were coded in SQL with supporting screenshot graphics.
